# Project 1
This project processes a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and uses multivariable logistic regression to predict heart disease.

## Installation
Download this repository as a .zip file, or clone it into your own repository.

## Requirements
Before running, you must have installed Python 3.6, Tensorflow, and Numpy.

## Usage
Use Python3 to execute the python file "main.py" inside of the src folder
In terminal:
```
python3 Project1/src/main.py
```

## Information about project
I am writing this project for an assignment in my CSC 546 Artificial Intelligence class to practice using various machine learning methods in Tensorflow. This project uses multivariable logistic regression to classify a patient as a target (or not) for heart disease.
